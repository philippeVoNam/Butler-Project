## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to have a command-line program that I can use to help with my daily task. The current program has been only tested on a Unix based OS.

## Features
Daily task such as : 
- getting the weather report
    - based on the weather, what kind of clothing do I need.
- taking a screenshot, saving the image in current folder and generating the appropriate markdown string.
- running a timer and alerting me to study or have a break.
